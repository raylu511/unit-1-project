# Unit 1 Project: HTML/CSS Foundations
## Raising Awareness on the Web

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
1. Assess your mastery of the HTML and CSS foundations covered in Unit 1
2. Push you to reach for advanced HTML/CSS solutions to address new design challenges.
3. Give you the opportunity to learn and raise awareness about a social issue that is of particular importance to you. 

### Groups
This project will be completed in groups of 2-3. Groups will add an additional set of complexities to this task, as developing software collaboratively requires coordinating schedules for meetings, negotiating product vision, developing and being disciplined about your Git workflow, among many other things. This, in fact, is the point. These are all thing that you will encounter on the job so we may as well begin preparing now! ðŸ˜Š

### Process
1. Identify a cause or social issue in your communities that you want to support, learn more about, or raise awareness for. This could be national issue such as voter suppression, racial injustice, or education inequality. You could choose to highlight a local issue or one impacting your family's home country. What is important to note is that you do _not_ have to be an expert on this issue nor does every single member of the group have to have expertise on an issue. You should think of this project as a learning experience that will start this week but will carry on throughout the year in L&D as we explore different social issue.
   > _**Pro-Tip:** Reach out to the 2020 Fellows for some suggestions on ideas to consider, if you find yourself stuck. This group has a number of interests and experiences that have been cultivated over the year.
2. Perform initial research on this social issue. Each person in your group will find relevant information on the issue and bring it back to the group for review. Together, you will decide what information should be highlighted in your website.
3. After you have performed your initial research, you will create a wireframe or mockup for your website. This will serve as the creative guide or outline for what you will build using HTML and CSS. **Your home page should be in an `index.html` file.**
4. When you have completed your website, your group will prepare a brief presentation in Google Slides in order to tell the story of the creation of your website. You will discuss the challenges and solutions that each member of the team had to overcome in order to ship the final version of your website.
5. We will present our websites on Monday, October 25. ðŸŽ‰


### Tips
* Start early. No matter when you begin, you will not feel like you will have enough time!
* Push yourself. This is the time to experiment with the more advanced techniques that you've been curious about. Don't be afraid to stretch yourself!
* That said, less is more. Pushing yourself should not come at the expense of your client. Take pride in being a _designer_ for this project.
* For those less comfortable in your design skills, check out the resources below.
