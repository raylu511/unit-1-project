        <h3> Adopting from a shelter</h3>
        <div class = "text"> Every shelter’s adoption process is different and similar in some ways. One way is if you are adopting online you will find the pet you want to adopt on the shelter's website. then the website will direct you to visit the shelter facility during their adoption hours or email them for an appointment. Afterwards You go to the shelter and ask the the person at the front desk if they have a staff or volunteer to take out the pet so you can meet with him or play with him and if you like the pet.
You then go to the shelter’s front desk and let them know you want the pet, then go through an interview with one of the shelter’s counselors, If you pass the interview and the pet you chose is the right fit for your family they will ask for your photo ID, you will pay the adoption fee (the average is $25 to $200), and get copies of the pet’s vaccination records and sterilization certificate so you can get him licensed.
then you take your new pet home</div>
