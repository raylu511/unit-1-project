                    We at E-Pet have been dedicated to the proccess of matching
                    pet owners with shelter animals for over a decade.
                    After going through the long and difficult adoption proccess with their pets, 
                    E-Pet founders Aldo, Damian, and Ray decided to build an online community
                    to match animal lovers with shelter animals 
                    and streamline the adoption proccess. 
                    We care deeply about animals at E-Pet, 
                    and paperwork and long applications 
                    shouldn’t get in the way of our furry friends being matched 
                    with loving and safe homes. 
                    Our mission at E-Pet is to save as many animal lives as possible--and to spread
                    as many resources and information about the adoption proccess 
                    and shelter animals as possible.
                    We do this with our partner organizations and with guidelines from APSCA, 
                    to make sure we deliver our promise to our furry friends and you in an ethical, 
                    and efficient way.

<li> <h1>Because you'll save a life.</h1>
<br></br>
Each year, it's estimated that more than one million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized in the United States, simply because too many pets come into shelters and too few people consider adoption when looking for a pet.
The number of euthanized animals could be reduced dramatically if more people adopted pets instead of buying them. When you adopt, you save a loving animal by making them part of your family and open up shelter space for another animal who might desperately need it.</li>
<br></br>
<li> <h1>Because you'll save a life.</h1>
<br></br>
Because you'll get a great animal.
Animal shelters and rescue groups are brimming with happy, healthy pets just waiting for someone to take them home. Most shelter pets wound up there because of a human problem like a move or a divorce, not because the animals did anything wrong. Many are already house-trained and used to living with families.</li>
<br></br>
<li> <h1>Because you'll save a life.</h1> 
<br></br>
Because it’ll cost you less.
Usually when you adopt a pet, the cost of spay/neuter, first vaccinations (and sometimes even microchipping!) is included in the adoption price, which can save you some of the up front costs of adding a new member to your family. Depending on the animal, you may also save on housebreaking and training expenses.</li>
<br></br>
<li> <h1>Because you'll save a life.</h1>
<br></br>
Because of the bragging rights.
No one needs to see another selfie—unless it’s a selfie of you with the adorable pet you just adopted! Adopt a pet, post those pictures and let the well-earned likes roll in.</li>
<br></br>
<li> <h1>Because you'll save a life.</h1>
<br></br>
Because it's one way to fight puppy mills.
If you buy a dog from a pet store,online seller or flea market, you’re almost certainly getting a dog from a puppy mill. </li>
